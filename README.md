# Java
Repository for beginners who want to know more about the java language  The aim is to go from the most basic to the most complex of object-oriented programming

To start we need to configure the environment:

First step: install java jdk

link to download jdk (this is the developer kit it has the jvm code interpreter): https://www.oracle.com/br/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html

After downloading, run the executable and always press next

Once installed, you will need to change your computer's environment variable by following this step by step
 1 - Look in the explorer for "environment variables";
 2 - when opening a window click on "environment variable";
 3 - find "system variables", click path and new;
 4 - put the path of your jdk/bin file which is located on disk c of your computer and ok; 
 5 - After that open the terminal and enter the command "java -version" to make sure that java is installed on your computer.

The next step is to install an ide of your choice.

Next I'll leave the link of the ide that I prefer is the VS CODE
and then the ECLIPSE
